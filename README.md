# Kropivnitskyi Bohdan - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About
My name is Bohdan, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree at Khmelnytskyi National University, majoring in economics, at the moment I am actively studying data analytics and doing various interesting projects.

## Python projects

[`translator.py`](https://github.com/krpvntsk/portfolio/blob/main/python_translator/translator(main%20file).py)
I carried out this project for my own purposes, to study English. The task was not just to learn words, but to put a special emphasis on words that I know less and to give out words in random order, that is why I developed this project. For this I used python with the PyQt6 library. This program can be used both for the purpose of learning new words in any language, and for writing down entire definitions for certain words, the main thing is to write everything exactly as it was during the initial recording when answering. I used my own simplified analogue of the Supermemo algorithm. The point is simple: if the wrong answer is given when studying a word, the weight of the word increases and it is more likely to be encountered again in the future.

## Python Data Analysis
[`Inflation_Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/krpvntsk/portfolio/blob/main/Data_Analysis/Inflation_Analysis.ipynb)
This topic was the most interesting, although the data was also not very diverse, just the same indicator for a large number of years. But during the analysis, certain significant problems appeared that needed to be solved. The data was somewhat cleaned and the analysis was extended by using population data to derive special indicators.

[`Wage Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/krpvntsk/portfolio/blob/main/Data_Analysis/Wage%20Analysis.ipynb)
The purpose of this analysis was to study the impact of certain factors on the amount of wages. Graphs were used for comparison and certain non-obvious results were derived and the most successful groups were formed to receive the highest salaries.

## A/B Testing
[`Campaign AB Testing.ipynb`](https://github.com/krpvntsk/portfolio/blob/main/AB%20Testing/Campaign%20AB%20Testing.ipynb)
Given the results of two advertising campaigns, the purpose of this test was to determine which of them produced better results. A clear statistically substantiated result was obtained and conclusions were formed.

## Machine Learning
[`Fraud_Detection.ipynb`](https://github.com/krpvntsk/portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Fraud_Detection.ipynb)
Determining fraudulent transactions is an extremely responsible task, and in this project, having data for model training, we were able to build an extremely accurate model that identifies almost all fraudulent transactions.
