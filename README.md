# Kropivnitskyi Bohdan - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About
My name is Bohdan, I am getting a bachelor's degree at Khmelnytskyi National University, majoring in economics, at the moment I am actively studying data analytics and doing various interesting projects

## Python projects
[`translator.py`](https://github.com/krpvntsk/portfolio/blob/main/python_translator/translator(main%20file).py)
I carried out this project for my own purposes, to study English. The task was not just to learn words, but to put a special emphasis on words that I know less and to give out words in random order, that is why I developed this project. For this I used python with the PyQt6 library. This program can be used both for the purpose of learning new words in any language, and for writing down entire definitions for certain words, the main thing is to write everything exactly as it was during the initial recording when answering. I used my own simplified analogue of the Supermemo algorithm. The point is simple: if the wrong answer is given when studying a word, the weight of the word increases and it is more likely to be encountered again in the future
